Selection and Transformation 
============================

selection:  picking certain elements out of a collection depending on some criterion 
ex: pick out all the odd integers of a collection.
while there are n elements in an array, selection always results in n elements or less.


transformation: manipulating every element in a collection. 
ex: increment all the elements in a array by += 1
Transformation always results in exactly n elements.
