-----------------------------------------------------------
NUMBER_WORDS = %w(zero one two three four
                  five six seven eight nine
                  ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen
                  fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen)

def alphabetic_number_sort(numbers)
  numbers.sort_by { |number| NUMBER_WORDS[number] }
end

- what is a tuple?
- does this first take the assign the number to the word using the position of NUMBER_WORDS[number]
  the sort this the word which word which is set equal to the number thus chaning number position as well?
  0, 1, 2 = "zero", "one", "two"
  1, 2, 0 = "one" , "two", "zero"
