In the below code `reduce` is called on the return value of the method `each_char`, however `encrypted_text.each_char`  returns an enumerator which I guess the `reduce` method is avialble to `enumurator`\n\n```ruby\n\ndef rot13(encrypted_text)\n  encrypted_text.each_char.reduce('') do |result, encrypted_char|\n    result + decipher_character(encrypted_char)\n  end\nend\n\n```\n\n\n- *Iterators: true for none?*: i got this correct, alternate solution that includes explcitly passing blocks which you should revisit. &block\n\n### EASY 2\n\ndefinitley review \n- each_cons (part 2):  I didn't even understand the solution. I think you need to understand the `*` operator better\n\n###medium 1\n\n- Text analyzer_sandwich code - this should probably be reviewed.  I figured out how to read the file, but i forgot about how to split paragraphs, sentences, and words\n\n- passing parameters part 3.  Review the explaination, how the splat opperator (*) is used in the explanation \n\n- !!!Method_to_proc!!! I was not able to solve this\n\n-bubble sort with blocks:  I don't undertsand how swapped ever evaluates to `false` unless it's already sorted\n\n\n###easy Medium_2:\n\n- **test prompt for payment method- tranaction** I don't understand why for the new `Transaction#prompt_for_payment` the parameter is defined as `input: $stdin`\n\n-**alter prompt for payment method-transactio**  I don't really understand how the `#StringIO` class works in combination with the `input: $stdin, output: $stdout`\n\n-**test swap method** understand how they configured the text with the `<<~TEXT.chomp` and closed with `TEXT`\n\n\n###Advance 1\n\n--**internal vs external iterators** this was fuzzy and should be revisited.\n\n---*lambdas, blocks, procs** you should review this again\n\n\n"
